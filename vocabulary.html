	   <ul>
       <li>Sprite - A graphics object that can be moved on top of or behind a background</li>
       <li>Stage - The background of a project, performs functions through scripting</li>
       <li>Costumes -  one out of possibly many "frames" or alternate appearances of a sprite; Sprites can change their look to any of its costumes. They can be named, edited, created, and deleted, but every sprite must have at least one costume</li>
       <li>Sounds -  Scratch's built in sound creator and modifier</li>
       <li>Iterate - Repeating a step-by-step procedure several times; also used to refer to single execution of that repetitive procedure</li>
       <li>Pseudocode - a way for developers to express algorithmic ideas without getting bogged down in syntactic details</li>
       <li>Pair Program - software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation</li>
       <li>Integrated Development Environment - Provides a developer with a way to create a program, run the program, and debug the program all within one application</li>
       <li>See Inside - to enter a project select “see inside”; usually a blue button in top right corner</li>
       <li>Camera - Press the camera button to take a picture.  The picture will load then you can press the button to return to the picturing taking mode</li>
       <li>Allow - give permission to a certain task; allow microphone, allow access to camera, etc.</li>
       <li>Save - enables program to be a file and cannot be deleted after being erased</li>
       <li>Import - To convert a file into the format required by the application being used</li>
       <li>Select -  process of highlighting text or picking an object</li>
       <li>Delete - erases a file or document from the computer system you are using</li>
       <li>Info - gives procedures, data, etc. on the project or file</li>
       <li>Event - a message from one thread to another on scratch</li>
       <li>Boolean Expressions - Evaluates to either true or false; used in the conditional of an if-structure</li>
       <li>If then - structure that evaluates a Boolean expression once</li>
       <li>Executes - To run a program or a single instruction</li>
       <li>Bug - Part of a program that causes an error or undesired output</li>
       <li>Debugging - The process of figuring out why code doesn't behave as expected and eliminating bugs to make it work as desired</li>
       <li>Central Processing Unit Core - The part of the computer that executes one instruction at a time</li>
       </ul>

     <h1>Rise of the Internet</h1>
 
    <ul>
       <li>packet - A chunk of data transmitted as a unit over a network, sometimes in smaller bursts called frames</li>

       <li>protocol - an agreed-upon method for conducting a communication</li>
       <li>IPv4 - The Internet Protocol version 4 is the dominant protocol for routing traffic on the Internet, specifying “to” and “from” addresses using a dotted decimal such as “122.45.255.0”</li>
       <li>dotted decimal notation - A representation of numerical data in which groups of base-10 numbers are separated by dots</li>
       <li>IPv6 - The Internet Protocol version 6 provides a large number of new addresses to route Internet traffic, using “from” and “to” addresses written as colon-hexadecimal notation, such as “fe80::42:acff:feaa:1bf0”</li>
